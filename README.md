# simpleCrawlingWithChatGPT
I wrote a simple python script to extract information and images from a Chinese e-commerce website that has unstable information. Script uses ChatGPT api to create more data and categorize gotten informations. 

# Why I used Selenium to extract information instead of bs4?
The website(Yupoo) has a well-structured security for crawling. The only way to surf between information and images was by doing it manually.
